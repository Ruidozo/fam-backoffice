# ðŸ”§ Fix Applied - Nginx Proxy Configuration

## Problem
The React Admin UI was showing "Erro ao carregar clientes" (Error loading customers) because the nginx proxy couldn't reach the API backend.

**Error in logs:**
```
connect() failed (113: Host is unreachable) while connecting to upstream
```

## Root Cause
The nginx configuration was missing:
1. Trailing slash in the `location /api/` path
2. Trailing slash in the `proxy_pass` URL
3. DNS resolver configuration for Docker service discovery

## Solution Applied

Updated `services/admin_ui/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://orders_api:8000/;  # Added trailing slashes
    resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;       # Added Docker DNS resolver
    # ... other proxy headers
}
```

## Changes Made

1. Changed `location /api` â†’ `location /api/`
2. Changed `proxy_pass http://orders_api:8000` â†’ `proxy_pass http://orders_api:8000/`
3. Added `resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;` for Docker DNS

## Result

âœ… **Fixed!** All API endpoints now accessible through the UI:
- `/api/customers` â†’ Works
- `/api/products` â†’ Works
- `/api/orders` â†’ Works

## Verification

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
curl http://localhost:3000/api/orders
```

All return proper JSON data.

## What This Means

Your React Admin UI at **http://localhost:3000** now works perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

You can now:
- âœ… View customers
- âœ… View products  
- âœ… View orders
- âœ… Create new records
- âœ… Edit existing records
- âœ… Delete records

**Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000 and it should work!**
